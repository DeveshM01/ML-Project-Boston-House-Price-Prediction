### Boston House Pricing Prediction


This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting house prices in Boston using the famous Boston Housing Dataset. In this project, we aim to build a predictive model that can estimate the prices of houses in Boston based on various features such as crime rate, number of rooms, accessibility to highways, etc.

# Dataset
The Boston Housing Dataset is a commonly used dataset in machine learning and statistics for regression analysis. It contains information collected by the U.S Census Service concerning housing in the area of Boston, Massachusetts. The dataset consists of 506 instances, with each data point having 14 attributes including features like per capita crime rate, average number of rooms per dwelling, pupil-teacher ratio by town, etc. The target variable is the median value of owner-occupied homes (in $1000's).

# Model
In this project, we experiment with various machine learning algorithms including linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting to predict house prices. We evaluate the models using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared.

# Results
The performance of each model is compared using cross-validation and the best-performing model is selected for final predictions.

# Conclusion
Through this project, we demonstrate the process of building and evaluating machine learning models for predicting house prices in Boston. The insights gained from this project can be valuable for real estate professionals, policymakers, and individuals interested in the housing market.
